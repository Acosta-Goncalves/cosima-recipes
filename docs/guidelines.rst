Notebook Guidelines
===================

For optimum presentation in the gallery, notebooks should follow a few
simple rules:

1. The first cell must be a Markdown cell containing a title
2. The first cell should include a short summary, which will be shown
   as a tooltip

By default, the chosen thumbnail is the last matplotlib figure in the
notebook. This can be changed by setting the ``thumbnail_figures`` key
in the notebook metadata to the integer index of the desired figure.
