    "## 1. The Cookbook Philosophy\n",
    "The COSIMA Cookbook is a framework for analysing ocean-sea ice model output.\n",
    "It is designed to:\n",
    "* Provide examples of commonly used diagnostics;\n",
    "* Write efficient, well-documented, openly accessible code;\n",
    "* Encourage community input to the code;\n",
    "* Ensure diagnostic results are reproducible;\n",
    "* Process diagnostics directly from the model output, minimising creation of intermediate files;\n",
    "* Find methods to deal with the memory limitations of analysing high-resolution model output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 A database of experiments\n",
    "The COSIMA Cookbook relies on a database of experiments in order to load model output. This database effectively holds metadata for each experiment, as well as variable names, data ranges and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two different ways for you to access the database:\n",
    "1. You can use the default database, which is periodically refreshed automatically. This database sits in `/g/data3/hh5/tmp/cosima/database/access-om2.db` and should be readable for all users. It includes all experiments stored in the COSIMA data directory under project `hh5` on NCI. The examples in this tutorial use this database.\n",
    "2. Otherwise, you can make your own database, which is stored in your own path and includes only the experiments you are interested in. Please refer to the `Make_Your_Own_Database` tutorial for instructions on how to create this database.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the default database, you need to start a database session each time you fire up a notebook:"
